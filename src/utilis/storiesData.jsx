    fullText: "In the slum where I live, many parents are worried about their children's education. Poverty and circumstances have forced us to always live from hand to mouth. Many girls could not study beyond class 8. My father is a tailor and the last two years, he did not have a job, owing to the pandemic. My mother, a housewife, had to work as a maid to make ends meet. Like many, I was also on the brink of dropping out from school. Had I not received the scholarship, it would have been almost impossible for me to continue with my education. I want to study science, pursue Biotechnology. And I want to help girls in my community complete their education.",
